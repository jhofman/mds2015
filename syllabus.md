## Grading 

Your grade will be determined by:

* Four homeworks (60%)
* Final group project (30%)
* [Scribed notes](/scribing) (5%)
* Class participation (5%)

Homework is to be submitted electronically and should include all code necessary to solve each problem along with a brief report of your results. All code should be contained in plain text files and should produce the exact results you provide in your writeup. Code should be written in bash / R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries. Late submissions will be penalized 10 percentage points on the first day and 5 percentage points for each day thereafter.

The final project will be done in groups, and will involve replicating and extending a published research paper. Each group will present its results to the class at the end of the semester.

Each student will also be responsible for scribing notes for one lecture during the semester which will posted to a shared, public repository. Students are expected to attend and participate in all lectures.

## Academic rules of conduct

Students are expected to adhere to the [APAM Academic Honor Code](https://apam.columbia.edu/academic-honor-code-0). You are welcome to discuss course content with other students, but homework should be done individually unless noted otherwise. Students must write and submit their own, original code. Sharing code for individual assignments is prohibited, as is the use of of any existing solutions found online or through other means. Violation of these rules will result in a penalty that may include zero credit for the assignment in question or a failing grade for the course.

## Office hours

Office hours will be after class on Fridays or by appointment.
