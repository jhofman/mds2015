The third homework assignment, [posted on Github](https://github.com/jhofman/msd2019/tree/master/homework/homework_3), is due on Thursday, April 11 by 11:59pm ET.

The first problem explores various modeling scenarios, the second looks at cross-validation for polynomial regression, and in the third you'll use regularized logistic regression to classify New York Times articles. Details are in the README.md file for each problem.

Your code and results are to be submitted electronically in one zipped (or tarball-ed) file through the [CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/77738) site. All solutions should be contained in the corresponding files provided here. Code should be written in bash / R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries. Each problem contains an Rmarkdown file which should be rendered as a pdf to be submitted with your solution. All work should be your own and done individually.
