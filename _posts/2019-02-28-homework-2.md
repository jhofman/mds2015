The second homework assignment, [posted on Github](https://github.com/jhofman/msd2019/tree/master/homework/homework_2), is due on Thursday, March 14 by 11:59pm ET.

The first problem looks at the link between coffee and cancer, the second problem examines an experiment on whether yawning is contagious, and the third problem involves replicating the results of a paper about the Google ngram dataset. Details are in the README.md file for each problem.

Your code and a brief report with your results are to be submitted electronically in one zipped (or tarball-ed) file through the [CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/77738) site. All solutions should be contained in the corresponding files provided here. Code should be written in bash / R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries. Each problem contains an Rmarkdown file which should be rendered as a pdf to be submitted with your solution. All work should be your own and done individually.
