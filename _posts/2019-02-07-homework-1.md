The first homework assignment, [posted on Github](https://github.com/jhofman/msd2019/tree/master/homework/homework_1), is due on Thursday, February 21 by 11:59pm ET.

The first problem explores various counting techniques, the second involves some command line and R counting exercises, and the third looks at the impact of inventory size on customer satisfaction for the MovieLens data.
Details are in the README.md file for each problem.

Your code and a brief report with your results are to be submitted electronically in one zipped (or tarball-ed) file through the [CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/77738) site.
All code should be contained in plain text files and should produce the exact results you provide in your writeup.
Code should be written in bash / R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries.
The report should simply present your answers to the questions in an organized format as either a plain text or pdf file.
All work should be your own and done individually.
