The fourth homework assignment, [posted on Github](https://github.com/jhofman/msd2019/tree/master/homework/homework_4), is due on Thursday, April 25 by 11:59pm ET.

The first problem explores the small-world phenomenon in "close" vs. "distant" friend networks, the second studies how the structure of an email network changes as we remove weak ties from it, and the third looks at gender assortativity in networks. Details are in the README.md file for each problem.

Your code and results are to be submitted electronically in one zipped (or tarball-ed) file through the [CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/77738) site. All solutions should be contained in the corresponding files provided here. Code should be written in bash / R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries. Each problem contains an Rmarkdown file which should be rendered as a pdf to be submitted with your solution. All work should be your own and done individually.
